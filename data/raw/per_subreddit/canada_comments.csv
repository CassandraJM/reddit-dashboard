ProfessionAny183,1jo46t1,"This promise to double housing construction to nearly 500,000 homes a year sounds great on paper, but it runs into some pretty major roadblocks in reality. First off, the construction industry in Canada is already facing serious skilled labor shortages—builders can’t even keep up with current demand, let alone double their output. On top of that, recent projections show Canada's population growth is expected to slow significantly, meaning we might actually need 500,000 fewer homes by 2035. Building at that pace could oversaturate the market, leading to vacant homes and wasted resources.

Then there's the issue of who actually buys these homes. Investor activity in the Canadian housing market is intense, and many new builds are snapped up before first-time buyers even have a chance. Just increasing supply doesn't fix affordability if homes are being treated as investment assets. Add in high interest rates that are keeping regular people from qualifying for mortgages, plus all the red tape and environmental concerns around development (like the Greenbelt scandal), and this promise starts to look more like political wishful thinking than a feasible plan.",1,Difficult-Yam-1347,1jo46t1,mkr3mme

Unlike the annual targets for permanent residents, the number of temporary residents is dictated by demand for migrant workers and international students.

MasterScore8739,1jo46t1,"To build 500,000 homes a year, you need to be building 1,370 every single day. That works out to completing 57 homes every single day.


[Here is a rough breakdown:](https://blog.remax.ca/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-house/)

1)The initial design phase of the house should take about one to two months.

2)Securing permits could take up to three months.

3)Once the construction phase begins, site preparation could take about two weeks, and foundation work should ideally be completed in a month.

4)Framing should take about one to two months.

5)Plumbing and electrical elements should be completed in another two months.

6)The finishing of the interior and exterior of the house should take about two to three months.
Final inspections and any adjustments required should take about two weeks.


Assuming all the houses are cookie cutter homes, you can knock off the first two steps. This also assumes permits and everything is done in bulk all at once. 

Even with knocking those off, you’re still looking at almost 7 months to build an average house. If you’re going cookie cutter and not doing anything fancy, all the layouts are the same or only slightly different, then I could see maybe 5-6 months per house. 

A framing crew seems to be anywhere between 3-5 guys as an average. So you’d need 170-285 people working around the clock to push out 57 frames within a 24hr period. 

That’s not including the fact plumbers, electricians, dry wallers, painters, and inspectors need to also go through the houses too. 

Unless we’re looking at it the same we automotive manufactures do, which is where each car rolling off the line is viewed as “X number built today”, it’s unreasonable.

The thing is, Liberals think making announcements and feel-good statements would fix housing. No it won't.

They need to pause immigration (not slow down, pause for a year or so) until they get new housing started (not announced, started, as in land rezoned, plans developed and approved). Only after then they can slowly ramp up immigration.

But, this requires hard work and they will not do it. Instead, they will make announcements, get headlines and try to sway voter decision. It's the easier way for them.",9,Difficult-Yam-1347,1jo46t1,mkp4sej

zacmisrani,1jo46t1,"They need to look into corruption in the existing system. There is a substantial housing supply but too many systemic issues. 

\- Far too many realtors have multiple properties. Every single one Ive met has more than 10. Thats absurd. Realtors should be limited to 3 max (primary residence, vacation, investment) like in Singapore. That alone will bring a lot of inventory back on the market.   
And they shouldnt be allowed to buy a house until its been on the market for at least 60 days and received bids. They see listings first and scoop up good ones before they even hit the market. This is an open secret, and needs to stop.   
Realtors in general need to be regulated more tightly. Far too many give off super creepy sketchy vibes, a la The Big Short vibes. When the corruption is this open, you know its endemic. 

\- Too much mortgage fraud. Too many people with houses they cant afford, and only surviving because of a renter. Those people need to stay out of the market if they cant afford 6 months of mortgage payments on their own, or have a job. But realtors give kickbacks to mortgage brokers who use their contacts to ""massage"" paperwork and get approvals. 

\- No corporations should buy houses until house ownership reaches a certain level. 

If they take care of these, lots of inventory will become available. And if they do it in a way that that inventory comes into the market in a staggered way, there wont be a  housing crash. But none of the parties are talking about this. Just building more houses wont fix anything if the above issues arent fixed.

Trudeau and Fraser tried to square the circle on affordability and not letting prices drop by committing to density and building apartments all while trying to juice demand and keep houses artificially scarce. Carney needs to say explicitly whether he is going to break from this, but his platform doesn't seem like it.

When it came time to blame, everyone pointed at the other players, and when it came to gain from federal program skiing each one opened wide like a nest full of seagulls. 

That holds true from the federal government level, as the various departments, and crown corps and agencies jockeyed for more funding to grow their operations; the provinces who used political games to get bigger slice with fewer conditions so that money could be used to fund “related” programs that would focus on party priorities; developers who looked to the most profitable development opportunities rather than ones that provided the most housing at the best value for the home owner, and even the trade unions. 

That said… bypassing all that to develop a crown corporation that actually builds houses for the purpose of housing over profit is the solution that I never imagined a government would have the guts to pull off.  

It basically runs the risk of pissing off every other player who stand to lose because they placed profit over public good. (No shit). 

This could actually work.  And if it does, I hope that the government will also become on-the-ground players in other fundamental sectors that are engulfed by hyper-greedflation and duopoly strangleholds.

NowGoodbyeForever,1jo46t1,"Yes, this has been promised by the Liberals for years. And the Conservatives. Because all of those promises still very much left housing under the purview of Provincial governments, and *that* has been where things have gone wrong.

Whether it's private companies dragging their heels and under-delivering, or promising developments being rejected or deeply compromised by zoning restrictions or NIMBY-esque local groups, housing has become an endless Goldilocks situation on a Provincial level.

It needs to be profitable, but also serve the needs of the local community, but also not upset the local residents or impact their theoretical future home value. That's basically fucking impossible, which is why the strongest eras of housing affordability are when they are treated as infrastructure projects by a federal government. It's true in Europe, and it was true in the golden eras of home ownership for America and Canada in the 20th century.

I live in an older Hamilton neighbourhood. Within a 3-minute walk of my front door, there are a couple of low-rise buildings and a duplex/triplex-style fully-detached house. Everything else is your standard mix of fully-detached and semi-detached homes. This is the type of zoning mix that Ford has claimed that everyone hates, and that would bring mass chaos to any municipality. It's caused zero problems.

Zoning laws need to be relaxed in a way that allows more types of homes to be built but doesn't turn every quiet neighbourhood into a mixed-use condo with a Rexall on the bottom floor. But if Build Canada Homes allows more units to be built that other developers have avoided because of a lack of ROI, then *that's what we need*. And I'd also deeply invite changing the regulations so developers are required or compelled to build houses, even if they're not maximized for constant ludicrous profits on their end.

My biggest concern is that BCH will also be **allowed to build homes on public lands**, which feels upsettingly close to what Ford gestured at with his Greenbelt sell-off. I hope this isn't just a situation where our greenbelts and parks will be turned into cookie-cutter suburbs.

Like since we complete about 200,000 units a year and each unit houses 2.5 people on average, we shouldn't have more than 500k growth per year, but it should be more like 400k since we already have a housing shortage.

- So, what he actually said is that he plans to cut all municipal water and transportation and other infrastructure grants, cut and gut summer youth program grants... all of it.

Ask literally anyone in housing, and they would tell you that they would never buy a house built today.   
  
The private sector will never, ever, willingly solve the issue on their own. Reducing red tape doesn't mean cheaper homes, it means more profits.   
   
Giving federal land to cities( private developers for cheap to replace the costly fees) who bought their land 40+ years in advance for dirt cheap is just a pure insult to government coffers. The feds own it, the feds can develop it better, and then the feds can sell it at reasonable rates and still earn a profit, becoming a ""green"" crown corp, while actually solving the housing crisis.   
  
Older private developers have so much money and they own the bulk of the smaller ""newer"" development companies. They're no where near a charity, never have been, never will be. They do NOT want to make housing affordable. They've reached a point where, without government intervention, they now completely control supply and their own prices they get to sell at essentially.

I think the primary fear of the previous government - the possibility of housing price reduction notwithstanding, given how much retirement savings are tied up in home values - was that this sort of direct action on housing is really in the domain of the provinces, with a few exceptions (like military housing, which is its own very distinct disaster).

canoeheadkw,1jo46t1,"Are you open to the idea of letting facts and data influence your position, or have you completely made up your mind on this?

Under Harper, Canada averaged 198,737 housing starts per year.
Under Trudeau, Canada averages 230,641 housing starts per year.

Now, the Prime Minister and the federal government are far from the main driving factor of housing, which is impacted by population and demographic changes, interest rates, economic cylces etc, but let's not pretend they throttled housing.

Additionally, since 2021 and the start of the current housing crisis, the country averaged 254,670 housing starts. 

Keep in mind that the housing industry moves at a glacial pace. It takes YEARS for any policy or funding to even start to impact the market. We already see supply catching up and rents dropping. Lower rents lead to lower house prices and in turn investors leave the market.

To speak to the lag in time, note that under Harper the first 2 years were the top 2 out of his 10 years. Trudeau's first year where he inherited Conservative housing programs were by far the lowest during his time. 

The data/facts suggest, that if you are worried about housing, and believe that the last 20 years is any indication if who is more likely to follow through on promises; it's clearly the Liberals. We just need them to keep immigration in check and better manage the demand side.

This would only account for the homes the government itself builds, not existing or new home builders that are also being incentivized.

Now 500k would be a lot, there is an existing program that for the last few years has been achieving 200k so this promise would be a 300k increase, this is a lot more reasonable as it only took them a couple years to scale up to 200k, it wouldn't take as long to continue to scale upwards as long as there is a labor force to complete the work.

These are also the smaller homes (less construction work) that most developers don't make because they are not really profitable. The nice thing about a government program is profit isn't the goal. Smaller homes are also much easier to afford especially in tough housing markets for young people to get into the market. 1-2 bedroom homes for young couples or single adults are much faster and less expensive to build and can be assembled in bulk. Zone an area, mark out the builds, start step 1 on plot 1 and just cycle through each stage of the process moving down the line.

This doesn't fix every problem but its a semi reasonable plan that is achievable and would make significant dents in our housing crisis. We can dislike the party but talk about a good plan being a good plan.

Pull up any chart on Canadian new housing starts, although the link above is the most comprehensive across many years and can narrow by regions:

- We have been plateaued at just under ~200K/year since 2002 (or might have drifted up pre-2008 and then reset down and stayed suppressed)

- Liberal National Housing Strategy was first launched Nov 2017. 

- COVID then happened, with strong suppressive effects early, but still managed to stay above 200k in large part because of upward pressure created by the National Housing Strategy initiative

- Since then, have managed *at least* a +20% boost over previous stagnated rate, clearly breaking through 20 years of stagnation.

So, while the past government was not as effective as you might have hoped... to say they did nothing is extremely disingenuous to the point of misinformation. They managed a +20% boost to an industry that had been stagnated for 20 years.

Without single family zoning, you can still build single family homes but there would be more freedom to build an actual community around the homes.

Why would you want the red tape that prevents you from turning your home into a duplex or opening up a small business in your own home?

Some people living in low density like their commute, but some people rage about it, get depressed about it, start petitions about it, elect politicians who are as angry as them about it, wish they could escape from the idiots who built the city and the idiots who are driving around them.  I know some nice people who have a complete personality change when they get behind the wheel of a car.

In what world do you think smaller homes won’t get bought by people with a lot of money and only bought by people with less money. 

If they build smaller homes, the people with more means will buy the larger homes AND the smaller homes. As you stated, they will be accessible to a larger pool, which will drive demand inversely proportional to price, which means they will be lucrative to acquire and rent out.

Short of mandating what builders can build with their own money and resources, you can’t avoid this.

>But these people need housing now.

I agree, it’s a problem.

>And in a society with social services like ours, not building homes poorer people can afford trickles to other expenses, like healthcare, transportation infrastructure, school districts, daycares, etc.

Mulroney and Chretien chose to make difficult cuts, one of those being public housing, to make sure the country remained solvent. 

What economic sacrifices did Trudeau make to improve the problem? None. He did not have the courage to make any cuts to help our financial position. Instead he spent wildly, cranked immigration to the roof and bounced before he had to face the music of his own ineffective policies.

>That's a great mantra, but it's not realistic.

You keep ignoring this part but it does work -- it's literally why we had a housing glut in the 60's and 70's. It's why we have cheaper electricity relative to income in Quebec than everywhere else in the world. If your goal is to make houses, then it works beter than literally everything else we have ever tried. I only 'doesent work' if you think someone elses profit matters even the tiniest bit as a measure of housing policy success.

>Habitat for humanity literally owns stores that fund it's projects. They don't take a loss at all. https://habitatrestore.ca/

Yes they do own stores -- and when you go in and buy something in those stores, the revenue goes towards building houses. That they give to people on 0% interest loans in exchange for labor hour commitments. Non profits dont reinvest into the company, they use the revenue they have to advance their mandate. This is built into the tax laws that govern NGO's -- and they can literally get in trouble just for having more than a certain ammount of money in a bank account. 

This is from their site; 

>""Since 2017, we have paid nearly $19 million in GST/HST, a tax we are required to charge on the homes we built, but **that we absorb to maintain affordability**""

Not only are they building houses for 40 years without a profit motivation, they're generating a net positive tax revenue building that housing while they employ all the builders and administration that they do.

And their financials are [publically available](https://assets.habitat.ca/documents/Financial-Statements-2023-Signed.pdf). In fact, EVERY non profit in canada has to pay a third party, CPA auditor to review their financials annually. I know because Im preparing the 12 month statement to hand over to ours literally while I argue with you.

No one ever said that they dont need to make money, but they don't need to make profit. You keep trying to imply that without a profit motivation then it wont get done, and that's false both logically, and historically.  Theres a crown corporation in existance now that for most of its history funded and directed the building of housing stock. It was a gem and [recognized by the UN](https://web.archive.org/web/20140909232847/https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/corp/about/hi/index.cfm) as a leader in the world for housing policy.  In the Regan/Thatcher/Mulroney that was stopped under the argument you're trying to rehash -- We have 50 years of proof that it doesent work.

This is just math. 100M - 41M = 59M. 59M/75 years = \~787000 people. If we remove our natural growth of around 17000, then it's 787000 - 17000 = 770000 people. So we need 770000 people per year for 75 years to reach 100 million.",1,Ambiwlans,mkpxvi9,mkq64ct

You are correct; 10k was facetious. I apologize for that. I should have made it 10k's or like +50k etc.   
  
I think housing is a service that society needs to provide to its people. 

If the person can't afford a house, they have to rent. Rent is an inefficient system where one person's housing needs to become someone else's income, which incentivizes them to leech as much as possible from that person. So we end up in a scenario like today, where rent is significantly higher than mortgage payments, but you can't save up for a down payment because you are paying inflated rent prices. 

I recognize that I am extremely fortunate. As such I was able to purchase a home. It's only doable because I am well connected and resourced so I can make the necessary repairs and renovations myself. My partner and I are both in positions of leadership and have decent salaries compared to even our staff. I live in a part of the country with less urban density than major centers like Vancouver or Toronto.

I was able to acquire for myself what many I know are denied the ability to have. I have had conversations with my staff on a personal level about their struggles and used what I knew to help them navigate their situation. They complained pre covid, they complain now.

None of what you just brought up has anything to do with immigration. The issue with immigration right now is the speed at which it's happening. There's nothing wrong with getting to 100 million if we can grow fast enough to sustain that. But forcing it to meet an arbitrary deadline when we're already floundering at the current, much slower, rate is absurd.

You're right, we're not like the US. We don't have the capacity for that scale of industry growth. More people require more jobs and more homes. And unlike the US, we have universal healthcare. Even before the current rate of immigration we had a shortage of doctors and overcrowded hospitals. New people will also be using the hospitals. Putting a massively increased strain on an already strained system is bad for everyone in the system. Including the immigrants themselves.

I don't care about late stage capitalism. That is not what's causing hospitals to put beds in corridors and leave people on waiting lists for years. That is not what's causing a huge increase in homelessness. We need to solve the resource problems before we start worrying about other things. I'm not saying stop immigration. I'm saying slow it down. A rate of .3% or .4% or even .5% would put us in a much better place. We can get to 100 million but why must it be by 2100?

Exactly. Because there's 0 correlation between the country you cited, their growth, and their state.

Same with UK. 


> I don't care about late stage capitalism. That is not what's causing hospitals to put beds in corridors and leave people on waiting lists for years. That is not what's causing a huge increase in homelessness.


It's exactly why those things happens though... Ford gutting healthcare in Ontorio for 3 mandate straight drove the quality of life down the drain massively. And why? To privatize more and more to bring in their friends in the private sector.

Homelessness is not just a problem of lack of housing, it's a problem of conglomerate buying an insane amount of properties and leave them empty to drive the price up. 



> My point is that you tried to make it seem that 1% is the norm and that is absolutely not the case.

No, I said it was a sound economical principle. Western countries being in a population crisis is not the argument you thing it is. 

Most rich countries are not or will soon not reach a population replacement rate, meaning without fixing the root cause we are facing a major crisis brought by population decline. 

And yes, immigration is a quick bandaid that doesn't solve the issues but maintain the economy kinda working and stop it from collapsing immediately. 




And if you want to talk about the root cause of that problem, I'll circle back with decades of conservative policies renoving all check and balance for capitalism and making it the monster it is now.

Reaching 100 million in 75 years is around a 1.2% yearly growth rate, which is not completely unheard of in Canada's history. For example, Canada's average yearly growth rate for millennials (1981-96) was just over 1.18%. Gen-X (1965-1980) was closer to 1.5% yearly population growth, and it just keeps getting higher the further back you go.

The entire population was smaller back then too. Our highest recorded population growth rate between 1950 and 2024 was 2.99% in 1959. But we only had a population of 16.6 million back then. And we didn't have the same housing crisis, homelessness crisis, or overcrowded hospitals and a shortage of doctors in previous decades.

We can't act like our country is in the same place it was in the 1960s during the baby boom. Pretty much every country had a growth rate of over 1% at that time. The baby boom was a global phenomenon. In fact, between 1851 and 2001 natural increase (Canadian birth rate) was the main factor for the population growth. Since then, it fell to about one third. As of 2023, international migration currently accounts for **96.7%** of Canada's population growth rate and natural increase accounts for 2.4% of growth.

And this is the key difference: infants don't need jobs. Infants don't need their own houses or apartments. Infants don't end up sleeping on the streets if they can't get a job or find a place to live. The growth increasing primarily due to births does not have the same effect as it being overwhelmingly due to adults. We had time to grow and accommodate them by the time they were old enough for those things to matter.

This comparison is disingenuous. It ignores where we are today. Today we see the country suffering under its current growth rate, so increasing that growth rate is a bad idea. Immigration should scale with the economy and our resources. We need to look at the full picture and its implications.

I think Telford is currently still around and will be offered another position in the PMO if Carney wins the election. You’re talking about a guy whose “new” cabinet was mostly the same as Trudeau’s after the shuffle. Also the same guy who personally called Sean Fraser and asked him to run again despite being deeply unpopular. Butts had also been a Trudeau advisor for a while now. 

You can’t say something is eliminated despite it still being a law with no concrete support from Carney that he will scrap the consumer portion. I also don’t think there’s widespread support for the big business portion as most people only know of the consumer portion. I fail to see how this is substantially different than Trudeau. Carney could have actually recalled Parliament to scrap the bill before triggering the election, there was nothing stopping him from doing that. 

No, a lot of Canadians have supported our energy independence well before the whole trade war debacle. We’re supposed to believe he’s had a change of heart now that he stands to benefit again from his new position? He was against the Northern Gateway expansion while economic advisor to Trudeau and Chair of Brookfield while him and his stakeholders benefited from foreign pipeline investments because Canadian pipelines are somehow not ‘economically viable’.

Carnet is a huge relief to those on the fence. He is a change of face, not a ""politician"" and has amazing credibility. Even his less than ideal aspects suggest a canny, shrewd man who knows his shit.

And he makes PP look like a boy running for class president.

I'd like to add that PP did nothing but attack JT and ginned up a largely false hysteria about JT and maybe some people are coming to their senses.

Finally, with DT upending all order globally, he remains a central concern and if he can't be handled Canada goes down the crapper.

PP is not only feeble on the international front (in part by design as he has a big antiglobalist agenda), he and his party ARE aligned with Trumpian values through and through. So that makes it about DT regardless.

A different take.  

It is shocking at how out of touch our leaders are and how schlerotic our governments are that this was not seen as an upcomming issue.  

Every scholar, journalist, and commentator warned of the consequences of Trump comming back. Yet all the politicians seem to have no plan A, B, C, or D in how to deal with it. Carney just seems to sound more different than Trump than does Poilievre and that is the reason for the polls bump.  

But like other serious problems: climate change, creaking federalism, national security, arctic sovereignty, lagging productivity for decades, economic viability in light of a now a rouge US. And no serious plans, answers, or even thoughts. All I have been offered for the past few decades have been slogans, tax cuts, pronoun policies, and a few consumer goodies.

Cause saying ‘knock it off’ is pretty soft especially when he speaks worse about our own country and opposition parties in a time where Trump is threaten to annex our country. His party also has ties with MAGA and running around in all that gear so how am I to believe he will be tough on Trump when he’s basically been all about Trump since he first started campaigning. Also PP’s ties with the IDU and all the people who are involved in that including Trump. He has never gotten a bill passed in his political career. He has no real world experience, just a career politician. We are heading into an economic crisis and who better to lead that than the guy with a PHD in economics",3,Appropriate-Pop3495,mkq3al1,mkqbj7t
Anonymouse-C0ward,1jo8pwo,"Trump has decided to wage economic war on Canada in the hopes it will degrade us as a country for eventual annexation. He is currently using economic and media weapons. 

The media weapons are the same ones that PP has used for the past few years (“Canada is broken” type stuff), and not the topic of this post - I can write a lot about it another time - suffice to say for now, when PP has been attacking Canada and Canadians in the same way as Trump, do we really think PP is the best person to put in charge of the country?

He (Trump) is doing this to damage Canada’s:

- fiscal stability (increased costs for Canadians and the government means reduced quality of life),
- monetary stability (ie the Canadian dollar in a global market), and,
- economic production capability (ie jobs for Canadians, and Canada’s global influence economically, politically, and even militarily - eg as part of NATO etc)

in the hopes that it will cause Canadians pain and lower quality of life, such that they will look across the border, think the grass is greener, and vote in a populist or simply overthrow the government through civil unrest, and force Canada to capitulate and become, in Trump’s words, the 51st state (if anyone thinks Canada would become a state with voting rights etc you’re lying to yourself… just look at Puerto Rico).

In a military war you want an experienced general to lead the military because they will know how to use the weapons the military has most effectively (not only “how to fire a gun”, but why, where, and when - or when not to, is important).

In an economic war you want an economist to lead the government because they have the proper set of skills, just like the military leader in a time of military war. And luckily it turns out that the most qualified person - likely the most qualified person in the *entire world* - is Mark Carney.

This is because:

- an economist understands the most cost efficient policies to implement to avoid the economic damage that is coming (important when the belligerent is 10X your economy and tariff war policies often come with damage to both sides),
- since economic policies work best when enacted early on before most of the damage is done (when a company leaves Canada, they likely aren’t coming back), having top level knowledge ready at the leadership level rather than having to rely only on economic advisors with potentially different points of view requiring evaluation is huge
- not only that but Carney as a central bank leader has learned when to speak and when not to - something which PP seems to struggle with, since every word the central bank says, official or not, affects the economy (just look at how economists and the stock market scrutinize the phrasing of interest rate decisions, etc)

He literally was invited to be the first non-UK citizen to take on the role of Governor of the Bank of England - the same role as Sir Issac Newton once held - because of how his monetary policy choices prevented Canada from entering a recession after 2008-2009 even though the US did. During that time he pioneered the use of quantitative easing (something that was developed in 2008-2009 and put into use on-the-fly) - and that’s a huge deal as it literally doubles the tools available to a central bank (the only lever central banks really had until then was manipulating the target overnight lending rates).

I am not aware of anyone in history that has led two G7 countries through major crises (Great Recession here in Canada and Brexit in the UK) as the head of the central bank; let alone in a way that let Canada avoid a recession despite the US falling into one in the GR (since the Canadian economy is, as we all now surely are aware, is so intimately linked to the US economy).

Beyond the Trump economic war, there’s more: we are facing a huge number of crises: global, foreign-targeted, and self-inflicted.

Giving control of Canada’s government to someone who has zero experience in the real world outside of government, someone who has spent his entire life in pursuit of becoming Prime Minister, who has an undergraduate degree in international relations, and who has done nothing substantial as an MP in all his years, is not a good idea, especially when the other option is Mark Carney, who has all the qualifications to lead in a knowledgeable way.

I’m not a bot or anything like that, and I’m not parroting a party talking point. I’m someone who has a background in business, entrepreneurship, finance, economics, and engineering. I’m someone who has people I care deeply about who will be affected by the anti-woke policies that PP would enact, in much the same way that Alberta has already under DS.

And of course I’m a Canadian living through our cost of living crisis, and don’t see how any of what PP proposes can get us - as in all of us - out of this. His policies seem targeted to helping only the voters directly in a pandering way that won’t actually resolve the challenge for the entire country, rather than offering real solutions.

Case in point: Carney’s HST break proposal on buying new homes if you’re a first time buyer vs. PP’s proposal to give an HST break for all buyers of new homes. If you give a 5% tax break for all new homes, the home sellers will simply raise the prices to account for it. However if the home builder doesn’t know who is a first time buyer or not, they can’t raise the prices without affecting their price point and competitiveness. Carney’s policy is a smart, targeted policy that takes advantage of economic incentives in a way that doesn’t incur the industry simply raising prices and making more profit (mathematical / economic game theory). Meanwhile, PP’s will do nothing useful and won’t decrease the cost of housing for new buyers or the rest of us due to the well studied methods in which companies choose pricing strategies.

And this is the qualification based argument - I haven’t even gone into why it’s not a good idea to put someone in power who campaigns on identify politics and three word phrases while catering to fringe alt-right views on women, LGBTQ+ people, etc.

Despite all the qualification based arguments we can discuss, this is kind of moot: when you’re walking down the street and someone is threatening you with harm, you run to the police station down the street, not the house with the white panel van and the creepy guy who refuses to get security clearance yelling three word phrases.",1,Appropriate-Pop3495,mkq3al1,mkqnev1

Yes by Trump not the whole america, he won't be there forever. Carney is talking about the US as a whole which is equally dangerous esp for Canada. Easiest way to takeover a nation is when it's weak. We see that right now with Greenland or even Ukraine, Taiwan will be another one soon. There's a reason why Ukraine wants EU membership as it would boost them economically. While Canada should trade with EU more it'll no way replace what the US market provides. Canada trades about as much with the UK as it does with the whole of EU, this is not by chance. EU has their own local monopolistic industries to protect.

Canada just doesn't know how to utilize them properly or by not giving them opportunities which are due to trade/labour barriers internally and not protecting domestic businesses like the US does against foreign takeovers, it shouldnt be impossible but there needs to be balance. Very important in tech/AI stuff.

[https://www.uschamber.com/intellectual-property/2024-ip-index?country=CA](https://www.uschamber.com/intellectual-property/2024-ip-index?country=CA)

This is a decades long issue no one has talked about. This is due to lack of leadership, and Carney has one little blurb about tech in his book or I've not seen him talk about it in anyway. He should know more than PP or anyone in here.

>Each province could be a part of the boom. European nations are looking to rearm and build new weaponry and equipment, and we have all the resources needed here. 



Sure will Quebec allow pipelines, rail, more/bigger ports? because it's pretty bad in QC with the corruption (see car theft) and politics so nothing gets done, this isn't a new issue but decades in the making.

They're mostly anti china probably all of these new regulations will end up specifically targeting china at some point. But there will be pain until that get sorted out. No one can save canada from that at least for now. One think i know is that this is the worst time for leftist policies, you can't pay for expensive programs if you're not making money (GDP per capita, productivity etc), you have to print more debt which will hurt even more. Carney has rightly said some good stuff he wants to do regarding better efficiency in the government but it might not be enough, right now it isnt.

So 2018 Brookfield management signed a 99 year lease for 666 5th ave which kushner companies (Kushner family business) owned. Brookfield paid 1.1 billion upfront, which is rarely ever done, while coincidentally Kushner companies was 1.2 billion in debt, effectively bailing them out. Kushner himself had a position with the Trump government as the senior advisor, dealing with Middle East relations and brokering the Abraham accords. Brookfield’s largest investor is the Qatar investment authority AKA the QIA. Right before Trump took office, Kushner company sought funding from the QIA, but was denied. Shortly after that, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and others launched a blockade against Qatar for supporting terrorist, and Trump backed the blockade, and there is even rumours that Kushner actively opposed efforts to mediate the crisis. Then out of the blue, Trump shifted his stance and he became friendly with Qatar, hosting Qatars Amir at the White House. Shortly after that, Qatar announced a significant increase in investments in the US, and just a few months later, Brookfield, holding billions on Qatars investments dollars, signs a 99 year lease bailing Kushner out of debt. 

Yea sure, there is no concrete evidence of US using political power to force money to bail out trumps son in law, but trumps son in law is in massive debt, Qatar refuses to bail him out, Trump increases pressure, Trump decreases pressure and Qatar money goes to his son in law.

Looking at both direct cost increases as well as (estimated) indirect impacts on the economy, the report findings were that if you pool all households together, rich and poor, then the average household lost money due to the tax.

However, if you actually split up the income brackets, the reality is that most households do in fact save more than they are cost. The top 40% seem to have paid in, the bottom 60% got paid out.

This is just not true. There are plenty of differences between all the parties, and different ways they will have an impact on people, directly and indirectly. Way too many for me to be able to go into, but just under Trudeau, they brought in the affordable child care bill. Everyone who has a child will benefit from this. And it helps the economy to provide affordable childcare to get more people working (and making money to spend, instead of paying for childcare) and a good economy helps everyone. And these people who are now working may be providing you with goods and/or services you need. They did that, largely with the urging of/support from the NDP/Greens. It's unlikely they enact that on their own, but possibly. No way the CPC ever institutes a program like that. 

If people want to know which party they align with the most, they can do the Vote Compass by U of T, which is a short quiz. (Hey, if people can do a ""What Harry Potter character am I?"" quiz, they can do this.) And everyone *should* be reading the party platforms of each party before they vote.",1,vba77,mkt00fx,mkt2bgq

Also, who would you suggest do this low-skill labour? Canada has had historic 25-year lows of unemployment during the Trudeau years (except during COVID, after which it went back to where it was), which meant our workforce by and large has been properly stocked, the “good” jobs all taken.
