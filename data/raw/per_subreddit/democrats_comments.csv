Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way‚Äîbut many Europeans pursue higher education (because it's free) and understand that even Americans are held captive by this regime. As far as I know from media reports, there are no significant negative experiences or sentiments against American citizens. However, anti-American products do exist‚Äîmost of them are linked to Republican sponsors, a.k.a. enablers.

You can check some of the European subreddits where Americans seek advice on relocating or finding refuge from this chaotic world. Most, if not all, are welcomed with grace and offered help.

We can only do so much from our side of the world.

As I mentioned here before‚Äîhelp us help you. If people choose not to vote or remain silent, we cannot change anything. If people won‚Äôt exercise their rights to resist the regime, we cannot do it for them.

One of the reasons why the EU is so reluctant to impose tariffs in the USA is not fear ( let's be honest - we kind of are ...rich ) , it's actually American citizens. A lot of them are descendants from Europe. It's like bullying your family members.",1,Haunting-Register-72,mktg7s5,mkthsa1
