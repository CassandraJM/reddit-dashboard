In last year’s Caperton decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a State Supreme Court justice in West Virginia who had been elected with the help of millions of dollars in campaign spending from a coal executive should have disqualified himself from a case involving the executive’s company.

“These two cases,” Justice O’Connor said, referring to Citizens United and Caperton, “should be a warning to states that still choose their judges by popular election.” Caperton V. Massey 2009

In the early 1990s, Errol, then aged 45, married Heide Bezuidenhout, a 25-year old he described as ""one of the best looking women I've ever seen in my life"".[24] They had two children.[25] Jana Bezuidenhout, who was his stepdaughter from that marriage, and four years old at the time Errol became her stepfather,[25][26] later became his romantic partner.

In March 2018, it was reported that Errol had fathered a child with his adult step-daughter Jana Bezuidenhout.[25][27] In July 2022, Errol gave an interview to the tabloid newspaper The Sun, announcing that he and Jana Bezuidenhout had another child.[28][29] Musk has a total of seven children, according to People magazine in November 2022.[15] Errol once commented, ""The only thing we are on Earth for is to reproduce.""[30]

Imagine you were planning another coup.  Would Teslas be good surveillance and then robomurdertaxis?

Would buying Twitter give you access to massive volumes of kompromat on huge swaths of individuals?

Would Starlink or PayPal give you any information that would be potentially valuable to find vulnerabilities?  Starlink in the super rich especially with their yachts.

What neighborhoods do Teslas tend to be parked in and where do they tend to be driven to work and by what demographics?

Would full access to every camera on every Tesla potentially be valuable to gather intelligence?

Would Putin want very app associated with Elon or his businesses to be malware or have a malware build ready?

Just scratching the surface but I encourage people to look at your understanding of Elon and his companies through the lens of it all being on Putins orders, just like Trump.

Child Rape Tapes convey more complete control than anything. Almost all of their top puppets are owned through proof of them raping children.  It's the only way the FSB/Mossad/CCP are comfortable investing so much power in them.  Bribery doesn't come close to sufficient with how much financial/political power they concentrate in their upper echelon of puppets.  Trump/Thiel/Vance/Peterson/Jordan/Carlson/Thomas/Diddy/Drake/MrBeast to name a very small sample across different parts of society.  Many for a long time, but Trump since the eighties is one of the longest tenured.

Here's a bit about Ghislaines dad from Wikipedia.

""The Foreign Office suspected Maxwell of being a secret agent of a foreign government, possibly a double agent or a triple agent, and ""a thoroughly bad character and almost certainly financed by Russia"". He had known links to the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), to the Soviet KGB, and to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad.[60] Six serving and former heads of Israeli intelligence services attended Maxwell's funeral in Israel, while Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir eulogised him and stated: ""He has done more for Israel than can today be told.""[61]

“I think there’s no stopping Elon Musk,” Putin told Carlson after the pundit asked him about the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence. “He will do as he sees fit. Nevertheless, you’ll need to find some common ground with him. Search for ways to persuade him. I think he’s a smart person. I truly believe he is. So you’ll need to reach an agreement with him because this process needs to be formalized and subjected to certain rules.”

Ms. Mitchell became an overnight celebrity against her will, and sued Globe International, the publishers of the Sun for Defamation and Invasion of Privacy.

Menanders-Bust,1joc5mf,"I’m tired of seeing these posts. Put your money where your mouth is. He told you what he was going to do and now he’s doing it, and many of the people who are upset either voted for him or (only slightly less bad) didn’t vote at all. Don’t tell me how much you hate the outcome. Be an adult and vote. 

And seriously, grow up. This isn’t a fairy tale scenario where you get to choose between your dream candidate and a villain. Almost always you have to choose between the lesser evil of two candidates you don’t like. Not liking either of the candidates is not an excuse to not vote. That line of reasoning is childish and delusional. Trump was elected as much because of the people who didn’t vote at all as because of the people who voted for him. 

And on the other side, you can’t disavow certain aspects of a candidate. You can’t say, well I voted for him to lower taxes. I don’t support him forcibly deporting people or implementing tariffs. Bullshit. You vote for the ENTIRE person, and you’re responsible for the entire platform of the person you voted for. You can say you’re a one issue voter, and if that’s the delusion that allows you to sleep at night, that’s your choice. But that doesn’t absolve you of responsibility for ALL of the policies that the person you voted for enacts, especially when these policies are not a surprise, but rather exactly what that person said they would do. 

If you’re unhappy with the current state of the country, grow up and make an adult decision - vote in accordance with your values. Vote realistically and think like a grown up and not a child. Many had a chance to prevent this and did nothing. Now they have to live with the consequences of their decisions, and in case people haven’t realized, it’s going to get dark - like, really dark. It’s already happening. 

Again, this man is doing exactly what he said he would do. He has not done a single surprising thing yet. He campaigned on enacting tariffs, deporting illegal immigrants, ending protections for LGBTQ and racial minorities, dismantling much of the government, huge tax cuts for the wealthiest 0.1% of our society. These are all things he said very plainly he would do, and he still received a majority of the vote.

I see the demographic reports of who voted for whom and who didn’t vote and I think, I’m an upper middle class straight, white, Judeo-Christian male. I’m in every “in group” there is. Whatever Trump does I’m going to be fine. No one’s coming to deport me. No one’s trying to take my civil rights away. No one’s going to cancel my
marriage. No one’s going to force me to carry a baby to term against my will. If groceries even double in cost, I can still afford them. I didn’t vote against Trump in this election for myself - I did it for you, for the very people who either voted for Trump or couldn’t be bothered to vote at all. And now these people are unhappy with how things have turned out. I’m honestly tired of hearing about it.

I see on Reddit a small amount on YouTube that people are not happy but I don’t see that mass protests/peaceful marches showing that the Americans are not happy with what is going on. 

The rest of the free world respects democracy and are respecting the will of the people. While the evidence to the rest of the world is the American people who elected the government are happy or complicit with how things are being run they have no right to interfere. 

Governments are commenting about the impact of tariffs on their own countries but are also respecting the people who elected the American government. 

With technology being how it is today and everyone having a camera on phones if the protests were going on large scale the information could get out. Just think how it does in countries under dictatorships. 

People still travel to America, journalists from the rest of the world are still freely living in America. 

I personally can only see that a majority of Americans don’t have enough concerns to see public protests.

It’s about being targeted. Choose the issues you argue about, and choose who you blame.

Example 1: Trans issues. Trans people make up around 1% of the population. Why on earth is this a core issue for most of America? Why are we arguing about it? This does not mean we ignore the issue, it means you start refusing to debate people on the right about it by telling them that it’s less than 1% of the population and that youth more concerned about cost of living.

Example 2: when engaging on a topic like cost of living, don’t start out playing blame. Not on trump, them, anyone. Just relate, get on their good side, make them trust you. And when they do, talk about issues happening that impact it, again not people. And at no point ever blame them for their votes. You do not win people over with accusations. Basic psychology.

Example 3: protest, while condemning violent and destructive protests when the topic comes up, then move away to the issue at hand. Again, without blaming the voter. 

In short do two things.

- destroy the narrative that the left wants to destroy right wing voters. Build trust.

- focus on issues that impact most people when engaging with the right. Stop engaging on issues that probobly won’t I’m at them at all ever.

As for ""all the evidence""  That's actually the simplest result.  Let's work the math out, shall we?

Trump got 77,302,580 votes.  Hillary: 75,017,613. Wasted Votes on 23 other people who would never ever win plus write in joke votes: 2,918,108

Add to that:  Those who didn't vote.  According to Florida's Election Lab, there are 246M people eligible to vote.  Doesn't matter if they're registered or not -- they're legally eligible to vote.

That means that something in the order of 90 Million didn't vote.  But they're still bound by the results of the vote.  They still have to live with it.  My argument is: They accepted the results of the vote by not voting.

  
So:  77.3M voted directly, 2.9M could have just stayed at home and done the same thing, and 90M more did stay home.   That's 170.2M out of 245M = 69.5%

Election fraud is any direct manipulation of election results through the voting systems, records, or both. Just for fun, I googled it after I wrote that, and Wikipedia describes it like this:

> Electoral fraud, sometimes referred to as election manipulation, voter fraud, or vote rigging, involves illegal interference with the process of an election, either by increasing the vote share of a favored candidate, depressing the vote share of rival candidates, or both

Besides that, it’s not our responsibility to feed other people throughout the world when we can’t even take care of our own people.

By discussing military strike plan in advance via insecure channels, they were all complicit in imparting a significantly heightened risk to the lives of those executing the strike. 

If Goldberg happened to be a compromised asset, many enemies of the state would pay a *fuckton* of money for information exactly like that to make it easier to kill American operatives. 

So, they clearly demonstrated beyond any shadow of a doubt that those peoples' lives mean *so little* to them that none of them could even be bothered to take the extra 2 minutes to hold that discussion in the secure facilities that taxpayers have spent tens of millions of dollars to have conveniently installed *in their own homes*. 

And instead of owning their mistake and using this as an opportunity to demonstrate true leadership and honor, they lie and say it never happened. Ok it happened but it wasn't classified. Ok it was maybe classified but it was a successful strike so it doesn't matter. Ok it might matter but it's actually somehow Goldberg's fault.

zenoe1562,1jnzfp6,"Donald Drumpf is such a fucking child. 

Ya know what? I’m glad that those two assassination attempts failed. Ya know why? 

Because we can give Donald Drumpf a fate WORSE than death: humiliation. His bullshit, lies, and temper tantrums are all available on the internet for all to see and reference. WE CAN WEAPONIZE SOCIAL MEDIA JUST AS MUCH AS HE CAN. Whilst braver souls take to the streets to protest, there are those like us who can use social media to show Donald Drumpf what a REAL witch hunt looks like. 

Daily videos, from thousands, if not millions, of people, all mocking Donald Drumpf. Incessantly. If he wants to bully us and the world, he better be prepared to take it in return. As we’ve so eloquently seen over the past decade, *he can dish it but can’t take it.*

So, bully the bully. Blast the airwaves with as much blatant vitriol as possible. If you haven’t already noticed, I’ve been deadnaming him. He clearly didn’t like Drumpf, otherwise he wouldn’t have changed it. But just take a moment and say “Donald Drumpf” out loud without sounding utterly goofy. You can’t, can you? He certainly likes giving funny names to things he doesn’t like, so let’s start by giving him back the name he tried to have scrubbed from the internet. 

I grew up being bullied, so I know all the tactics. My response to it was simple observation. Learn what makes the bully tick, then dismantle them by exploiting an insecurity. They will destroy themselves trying to reclaim their “power” over you. They will become impulsive and begin making rash, reckless decisions. They will push harder to position themselves as “above you” only to expose more cracks to exploit. Only once his image, his persona is so thoroughly deconstructed and utterly shattered, will his people see him for who he really is. 

And there will be nothing he can do to sway them back.",4,Ace-Cuddler,1jnzfp6,mkpwbqs

They've spent every other minute of their lives looking down on the working poor and victim-blaming everyone below the poverty line while treating them like shit. Now they suddenly care about food insecurity and the cost of living? It never passed the smell test, so I did a fun little investigation into about twenty of these profiles, excluding the few self-aware enough to hide their reddit history behind a throwaway. You know what I found in *every single one of them*? An excess of privilege.

They'd have posts on PCMasterRace. Either pictures of their desktop towers stuffed to the brim with bleeding edge, enthusiastic grade compenents, or they'd be actively bragging about upgrading their 40 series GPU to the 50 series. I would constantly see people saying how ""GPU prices are nothing, I wipe my ass with that money."" Call me crazy, but if someone cannot afford a dozen eggs to feed themselves, they're probably not buying computer parts, nor do they have the free time to brag about it.

They'd have posts on vent, sipstea, and anywhere else that would let them, bitching about tipping culture. How it's ruining all their favourite goods and services. If you can't afford to feed yourself, how are you paying for the cost of food, the additional cost of the business rent, and the cost of labour of the people seating you, serving you, and making your food for you? Shouldn't you be cooking for yourself to minimise these apparently crippling cost of living expenses?

Then there'd be MaleLivingSpaces. Many of the biggest whiners would either live in heavily furnished high-rise condos with gorgeous views of the city, or a suburban home  with a front yard that dwarfs whatever apartment that the working poor shares with four roommates. It's really hard to hear someone whine about the cost of living, when they're living la vida loca in the middle of New York, Houston, etc.

Last but not least, they'd have pictures of their vehicles in pics. Lifted pick-ups, dodge challengers, and all sorts of expensive luxury vehicles. The kind of vehicles that say ""Hey! I'm not struggling to feed myself"" as they actively whine and show off their shit-caked diapers over the cost of living.
