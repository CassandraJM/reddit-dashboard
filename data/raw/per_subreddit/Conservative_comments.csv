The concern I have is this is the same way Russian's operate in that everyone breaks the law and those in the ""in"" group are immune from it in so much they follow the ""party"" line.  If you step out or threaten the leader/party then they throw you in prison for the crimes you committed even if everyone is doing the same.

Then you have the lawfare for targeted at Trump which was even more ""show me the person and I will show you the crime"".

Anyways, Turkey is a bit different than the rest of Europe where Erogan is more of a dictator who has been manipulating the constitution to stay in power longer and is trying to do so again.  

I think most of us here would agree that on form, we want the laws being applied to people equally, but only feel the laws are being applied unequally (the assertion of OP is done to keep the out-group out of power).
