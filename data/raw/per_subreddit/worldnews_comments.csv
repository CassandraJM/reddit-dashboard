False corruption charges are a regular enough thing in politics, best if popular politicians do have a shield against that, whatever their stripes.

Honestly, call me paranoid but this stuff makes me suspicious. It's a pretty ineffectual blow - someone else can just take over the party. While really making the far right martyrs. This is probably something that will help the far right, not hinder it, right? We love martyrs - even if Europeans aren't all practicing Christians, we've got Christian values, martyr are the top. And everything is so BS these days, we trust those that are persecuted, love the underdog, if the media and courts are attacking someone that IS a pretty good sign they are doing good in the world, so the far right might be hacking that logic!

MorningGoat,1jnyyz8,"Fun fact, for those who might not know: 

While you might have heard that Fanta was invented by or for the Nazis, the truth of the matter is actually much more mundane. 

The original “Fanta” soft drink was created in Germany in 1941 after a trade embargo was placed on Germany by the United States (‘cause, you know, the whole Pearl Harbour thing), which made it impossible for them to import — among other ingredients — the syrup needed to make Coca Cola. 

To get around the ingredient shortage and keep the plant in operation, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland at the time, Max Keith (pronounced ‘kait’), came up with a new soft drink which used ingredients that could be sourced entirely in Germany (like sugar beet, whey, apple pomace, and other fruits, depending on availability). And while it was marketed as a drink, it was also used as a household cooking ingredient, since sugar was being rationed. 

And that’s pretty much it. Max Keith might have been German-born, but he wasn’t a Nazi, nor did he work for them. He was just a 30-something year old business man doing his job and Fanta was just a soft drink that was invented due to the circumstances of WWII. Keith handed both the plant and the Fanta drink back to the Coca-Cola company once the war ended.",47,Screamline,mko68ev,mkpu78f

Fanta was invented to keep the German branch of the Coca-Cola company open and in production, which kept many people employed and salaried throughout the war. That’s it. 

“Invented by or for the Nazis” implies that the Nazis directly benefited from its creation and sales, which they just didn’t. Max Keith had been pressured to join the Nazi Party and he refused. And while yes, he did have to comply with German bureaucracy to some degree, it was to avoid the being replaced and the company being nationalized. The situation wasn’t black or white. 

Keith handed both the drink and the profits made during the war back to the American company after the war had ended, even though he could have kept both and continued selling Fanta under his own name. 


When you consider that some people have exaggerated the actual facts of the situation into myths like how Fanta was created because Coca-Cola didn’t want the bad PR of marketing the same drink to both the Allies and the Nazis (I’ve genuinely heard this said IRL when I was younger), then yeah, I think it’s fair to say that I’m not just splitting hairs.",5,d3l3t3rious,mkqtr0u,mkr0bco

This too was a fiction, given that the parents of these children had already been deported; documents of the period have revealed that the anti-Semitic Laval's principal concern was what to do with Jewish children once their parents had been deported.

Nope. Not *anti-immigration*. That's the problem. The CDU (conservative centre-right) also wants to tighten immigration rules. 

The AfD took anti-immigration to a new level and turned it into *remigration*. They have essentially advocated for the ability to be able to send immigrants away who are here legally. They have also advocated for sending back refugees that are legally protected. You can even find *re-migration* as a Wikipedia article that exactly describes how it is related to the far right as they want to target even descendants of non-German immigrants (i.e. descendants of Turkish workers that came to Germany in the 60s). This is non-constitutional.

>Should we considers all those who voted for the AFD as fascists with skewed worldview and crooked morals?

No, their voters are of no concern to the process. People can vote for them because they like blue for all we care. It's the politicians *leading* the party that are the problem, not the constitutens voting for them.

>it against comes back to my earlier comment, can they be called fascists?

According to the German constitutional courts, yes.

>if they are, how come a fifth of voting Germany seems to resonate with them?

This is a non-sequitur. 

The fact many people voting for them does not make them *not* fascist. The fact few people might vote for them doesn't make them fascist. The ruling was based on their politicians, their comments, some of their political points and their insistence on trying to do things that are non-constitutional.

They are also not advertising as ""Vote for us for fascism!"", but running on the age-old fascist tactic of a declining country that needs to be protected at all costs, immigration destroying ""the soul of a nation"", have at several points denied or partially denied the facts of the Holocaust (which is illegal in Germany). 

People are voting for the AfD in larger numbers because they feel ignored by the established CDU/SPD/Green ""establishment"", not because they want fascism. How many vote for them has no bearing on whether the constitutional court finds them ""to attempt to subvert or destroy the democratic constitutional order.""

>*to create a tolerant society we should be intolerant toward X*.

I do want to emphasize that I am not defending the AFD themself, rather I simply see a lot of hate directed toward a group And feel like hate should be tempered with empathy.

And it's more of a labeling of a certain group as hate-worthy which is very reminiscent of oppersion of a view point. That seems to me very similar to the intolerant propurted to the group.


The the paradox of Tolerance is interesting, since many great minds have debated it, I won't attempt to provide my own dull perspective. But I again come back to my original point. 

So let's say we have argued for limiting the intolerant, okay. But who decides what opinion is worth toleranting and which is worth suppressing. I could say a man who opposes gay intercourse is intolerant, but I could also say the men who oppose intercourse between men and animal is intolerant. Yet, it's obvious that one is completely natural, and the other is completely morally bankrupt. 

To me, it seems like we have a certain line we can all agree on, but on reddit that line seems moved to the side. ""all those who do not believe as I, are fascists"", and fascists as we have agreed are not to be tolerated. Therefore, they should be, at best ignored or at worst somehow silenced. That line, seems to be whatever the left leaning political consensus is on that particular month taken to some militant extreme.

I just find it silly given the prominence of differing opinions, how quickly that line of thought judges at least half the population to be fascists, at least on this platform.

Again, the original point I was making is not on the character of the AFD, rather, I see so many people called fascists online, that if we say fascists shouldn't be tolerated, we ignore the reality that many of those classified as such by netizens are not really fascists, rather people with different viewpoints which can be talked to, debated with and have their opinions changed.",1,BCMakoto,mkqbiyu,mkqkj7u

Stalin believed that grain was being hoarded by kulaks in Ukraine (grain was in fact being burned by the Ukrainian kulaks to resist state collectivisation efforts during this time), and this belief in hoarded grain meant Stalin continued to export grain from Ukraine during the famine. 

With that said, I’m not going to defend every Stalinist policy. It’s more important to just say that, Stalin and the USSR did play a very important role in the defeat of fascism, post-war decolonisation efforts, promoting gender equality in education and the workplace, promoting literacy, developmental assistance in poor countries, and so on. We take these things for granted today, but capitalists in that time thought of these as socialist follies or threats to the traditional western way of life - it was through vigorous Soviet promotion and the need for the West to respond to the Soviet threat that these ideas became mainstream globally ",0,The_Motarp,mkqghg0,mkrnioc

Maintaining autonomy from Europe means being able to maintain land borders, and maintaining land borders is a lot easier if you have the Carpathian Mountains as a defensive buffer.

That’s how the USSR did it, and that’s in Putin’s playbook too.

Where he went wrong was in building a corrupt regime of “yes men” and allowing his oligarchic billionaires to defraud his military.

If Russia had actually had a strong military like the world thought, he would have taken Ukraine, probably in the day 1 assassination of Zelenskyy coup, and already be working on the Baltics/Moldova/Romania.

His plans, if we’re being free with speculation, probably went as far south as Turkey, as I’m sure there’s some delusion of grandeur at the idea of taking Istanbul and declaring himself the new Holy Roman Emperor.

Also a couple hundred conscripts are definitely coming from Moscow and St. Petersburg, but definitely less than in the other regions, as the mandatory army service can only be easily dodged if you have money.

Not everyone(I’d even say the country is divided roughly 50/50) in the rich regions supports Putin, however everyone has something to lose, and because of that no one speaks out. 

I’d say the divide is really similar to the American divide currently, because you have to test your waters before talking politics to anyone, nonetheless, please do not blame the common folk. (At the very least definitely not those who were forcibly drafted, and the indoctrinated 18 year olds who just began to see life and fell in hands of manipulative oligarchs)

In the third year he was conscripting people in Donetsk and Luhansk to fight there. the fact that he still enjoys domestic stability in the fourth year is why the strategy of throwing money instead of politically important citizens at the frontline will continue. it will only be from defeat that the full details of all these war crimes will come to light.

it has not reached the stage yet where he needs to conscript ethnic Russians to the front line as long as the war economy allows. that is to say, they don't have a manpower problem despite all the losses, as long as they have money, which they do, provided by EU not only continuing but increasing their buying of Russian fossil fuels since 2022.

meanwhile for Ukraine it is much more dire. they actually have a manpower problem and failed the recruitment project the same period last year, hence the retreating front line of 2024.

Criminality and alcoholism ran rampant. The giant State owned corporations simply ground to a halt.


In the middle of this a general election was called, the first one. And Yeltsin presents Putin. In the election the mayor of Moscow is a huge favourite, no one had even heard of Putin. So of course he wins.


Steadily during Putin's first two terms society improves massively. Inflation gets under control, food returns to the stores, free healthcare and education is implemented and is quite decent.
Sure everyone knew Putin is crooked, but he has fixed things. Crime is down, and he keeps the Oligarchs in check.

Russia's not sending actual conscripts (which indeed is ISW's assessment too) - A few were sent in the initial invasion, but that was likely contrary to Putin's orders and being done by lower-level commanders who wanted to hide that they'd been reporting inaccurate numbers of actual soldiers (and since it was a 'three day operation' who's to know?)

There's no evidence Russia's sent any real number of actual conscripts nor intends to do so. It's simply illegal (by a law Putin himself has put in place), violates the countless times Putin personally promised _not_ to do so, and they're fairly useless as they're not fully trained. Russia has tons of trained men in their reserves that they can mobilize, and even if Putin is hesitant to mobilize as well, it's far, far less politically controversial than sending conscripts would be.

Bottom line is that Russia lost the First Chechen War because they used conscripts and people were furious about that, and Putin knows this lesson.

Robinsonirish,1jo72rx,"I wanted to join the military since I was a kid, my dad was a ranger, or jaeger as we call it in Europe. I went through selection, spent a couple of years training to become good at my job and wanted to not just ""practice football"", but also play match. I wanted to see foreign cultures, experience what it was like to get in combat and be shot at(remember I was a naive 20 year old), I wanted to go on adventures and do high adrenaline shit like fly helicopters and blow shit up. Most guys around me were the same, to train someone to go up against Russian machine guns you need a certain amount of brainwashing, that's just how it is in every military. 

Well, when I got to Afghanistan I got my wish. First tour was so chaotic, the culture shock was insane, combat every day, just IEDs everywhere, had a couple die and some lost limbs. I learned a lot and enjoyed my time there, as weird as that sounds. We all went down there with both eyes wide open, knew the risks and were prepared. It was hard seeing friends get injured, but I didn't regret my time there, I really enjoyed the challenge, the lifestyle of just putting everything on pause and just trying to survive one day at a time. The friendships we made were for life, can't get that anywhere else. It's protecting yourself from PTSD and staying effective if you don't let things get to you, going down there prepared and with the right mentality is crucial.

2nd tour was a lot slower, the high Taliban high command in Pakistan told their people to start using more IEDs, less small arms fire, they were getting too many casualties. So my 2nd tour there was just pulling up IEDs all day and sometimes stepping on them. We didn't see an enemy anymore, which was very smart on the Talibans part. Another thing that happend during my 2nd tour was that I really got to know the Afghans. As a squad leader I'd spend a lot of time talking to them, getting to know them, how they work and think. Afghans have some terrible qualities but also some really good ones that we just don't posssess in the west. If they are your friend they will literally die for you. If they are starving and freezing to death in winter, they will still give you half. 

I fought with the ANA and ANP, there was so much corruption but I gained so much respect for my enemy, who I understood were just defending their country from a foreign invader. They weren't religious zealots, they drank alcohol and did drugs just like everyone else. I like to think it's similar to what would happen if Russia came to my country, it was bombed to bits, I'd been at war for 40+ years. I'd also turn to suicide bombings and IEDs if that was my only option. We labelled them as terrorist weapons but they're not, they were just desperate. 

On my third tour I was more dissilussioned by the whole thing, feeling bad for the Afghans and wondering why the fuck we were opening up exactly the same roads, stepping on IEDs at the same junctions, things just getting worse and worse and worse.

I loved my time there. I never had the goal of killing anyone, that is true, but I wanted to experience combat. Once I had enough of combat it wasn't fun anymore and we all did our best to limit the damage we did down there, to not pull the trigger whenever we could. Our generals would all say at home during their speeches ""you make a difference"", but once we got down there and saw it for ourselves we all knew we weren't. I would tell the new kids that if they went to Afghanistan to change the world, save women and children, make the country a better place, they went for the wrong reasons and would be sent home with PTSD after 3 months. If they went for adrenaline, adventure, see new cultures, learn new things with their best friends they went for the right reasons. It's simply self-preservance.

Our country was there to help the Afghans, truly, but the mission was just misguided. I've seen women stoned, I've seen kids raped, seen kids freeze to death in winter, we wanted to do something about that but the Afghans didn't want our western ideals and democracy from the start. Afghans want a strong leader who takes power, they think people are too dumb to vote and we were never bringing our way of thinking to them, we were misguided. We should have gotten out when Bin Laden died, cut our losses instead of kicking the ball down the road.

The Russian media also doesn't love covering tons of stories of dead Russians either and the people searching online for obituaries will obviously not find all of them.

Yeah dude, I thought that went without saying. That's WHY we're talking about 'a drop in a bucket', that's why I keep emphasizing how low this proportion is of their population, fighting men, whatever number you want to use: No one's claiming that Russia can keep up this pace for a century until they've sent every Russian male into the meat grinder, but they can absolutely keep this pace up for years before it becomes a serious problem for them at home.  

To give you some actual math, lets imagine of those 35 million men, half are city dwellers who Putin doesn't want to antagonize for the reasons above. Of those left, let's say half fled the country or have connections or are dodging the draft some other way. Of the quarter-of-a-quarter of the population that's left, let's say Putin can't conscript more than a quarter of *them* before seeing serious rises in unrest. That's still 2.25 million men, more than DOUBLE the number of casualties they have plus this round of conscription. It all indicates that Putin can keep this aggression up for at *least* another three years, while Ukraine has just lost its biggest ally. And I wouldn't expect a dictator to stop just because of unrest, it would take the actual, complete collapse of the regime, and no one can truly predict how much the Russians will take before it comes to that. It's not that Russia still has infinite manpower and victory is impossible, but the picture is grim.  

So that's the point of the 'drop in a bucket' comments, that's why it can make sense to compare these numbers to total population - when you understand that only a small fraction of those people can realistically be thrown into the fight, you can also see that the fraction that HAVE been thrown into the fight is still much smaller.",1,Superfluous999,mkr76zx,mkszoc9

No point was ever made about the war and its outcome by me...you're setting up a straw man argument and arguing against air.

This is purely, and utterly to say...it's a problem for Russia that they are conscripting another 160k, and it isn't a drop in the bucket when you consider Putin's shorter and longer term ambitions along with domestic considerations.

Its 160k now, the war is grim for Ukraine but it's not rosy for Russia, either, and unless they somehow end it over the summer -- seemingly unlikely -- it'll be more.

Putin doesn't want to just take Ukraine, he wants the Baltic states. How is he to to do that with a military that's got all it can handle with Ukraine? Every month shrinks his pool of available folks -- you listed a lot of the attrition in this regard  so thank you -- because his people will start to become restless.

So 160k simply isn't a drop in the bucket because this can't just stay forever in the rural places that aren't Moscow and St Petersburg, it's tacit admission that the need more help, they need conscription to get there, and that there absolutely will be more if they can't end this soon.

Time will tell but I don't think we're giving the Russian people a fair shake...they are definitely under Putin's heel, but this doesn't guarantee him anything as when things in Russia comes to a head, it always comes via coup d'etat.

So the pulse of the military is vitally important, and conscripting 160k will not sit well with at least a few of them

Robinsonirish,1jo72rx,"Well, first of all, the US barely cared about Afghanistan, more about keeping the Soviets at bay. The Taliban sort of came out of nowhere, are really powerful and are a perfect fit for the Afghan geography. Afghanistan is very mountainous and rural, people often haven't even travelled further than the next village over in their lifetime. For a lot of them all the education they've gotten is what they learn from the local Mullah. 

Al Qaeda started out as freedom fighters, Mujahadeen fighting against the Soviets for Afghanistan, it wasn't until later they started their terror campaign. They weren't friends at with the Afghans really, they assinated Masood who was the leader of the Northern Alliance just before 9/11, who was a popular guy in Afghanistan. 

When 9/11 happened the US demanded the Taliban to hand over Bin Laden. Taliban was going to do it and said they'll hand him over to a 3rd country. It didn't really matter what the Taliban said, the US was out for blood and declared war on them 24hrs later. 
Al Qaeda aren't Afghans. Sure there are some Afghan fighters but the core are made up of Egyptians, Saudis, North Africans, Yemeni, Kuwaiti and so on. They weren't friends with the Taliban, which people often assume.

Anyway, we as the west decided that Taliban were bad and needed regime change. They obviously have some very deep faults, we see that today with how they treat their women and how radical they are in western eyes. So a coalition of like 50 countries under NATO flag tried to build up the country and give it some stability. This was in adjacent to hunting Al Qaeda. 

The main goal from our coalition was to build schools, form an Afghan police and military force, build wells, NGO stuff like that. This all worked pretty well up until like 2008, there wasn't much fighting in the first years. Then shit hit the fan and we started increasing our military presence. We spent more and more time fighting, less time nationbuilding. The Afghans didn't want us there. Then I arrived in 2010 when it all had gone completely to shit.

Anyway, if you want to read a really good book on Afghanistan from the Soviet invasion up until 9/11, I suggest Ghost Wars by Steve Coll, it won a Pultizer prize. It's insider info on CIA's role and how they shaped Afghanistan and what led to 9/11.

To get out we had to hand over control to the ANA and ANP because handing over to the Taliban would be admitting defeat. So we did our best to train them as well as possible and get them ready, but us on the ground knew it was pointless. The big problem with ANA and ANP was that they were made up of minorities for the most part. Tadjiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, but the real power in Afghanistan and who made up the Taliban were Pashtuns.

In fact this directly ties in with your comment about 35mil not being an amount you can just spend, no one else is thinking in those terms so it doesn’t matter.  No one but you said anything like that.

warhead71,1jo3lcf,Nah - the British could have gain a foothold in Scandinavia if Sweden joined the fight. Germany didn’t have a an intent for a hard occupation of Denmark  - and Denmark kept its government and army. But anyway - hard fights with Nazi-Germany could have been counter-productive since Germany and Russia were allied at this point and WW2 could have played out very different. That Sweden later accepted Nazi-German transport through Sweden is also a lot because Sweden is and were pro-finland,0,EpicCleansing,mkqwimb,mkr6tjr

Jacc3,1jo3lcf,"Judging by the press release, almost 2/3 of the aid package will go to primarily Swedish but also other European contractors, and 1/3 to Ukrainian contractors.

Possible Swedish contractors include Saab, the Swedish subdivisions of BAE, and Nammo. Possible products include air defence (RBS70, Tridon Mk 2), artillery ammunition (from Nammo), IFVs (CV90), APCs (BvS10), SPGs (Archer), anti-tank weapons (NLAW, AT4, Carl Gustaf) and radars.

The Ukrainian contractors will probably cover things like drones and artillery (ammunition).

Other European contractors will likely cover things produced neither by Sweden nor Ukraine, such as longer-range air defence and satellite communication.",11,ChiTownDerp,mkozcxj,mkp9u2g
moofunk,1jo3lcf,"""Comparable weapons"" is a bit of a misnomer. The US boasts of Bradleys and M1, but they never sent enough to matter. The most important systems have been Patriot and HIMARS.

Europe has a more focused arms manufacturing industry, where the US tries to be jacks of all trade and just outspending everyone.

Rheinmetall is setting up factories inside Ukraine to build thousands of Lynx AFVs, and Ukraine themselves have the world's largest drone manufacturing industry in unnamed factories.",8,ChiTownDerp,mkozcxj,mkp6s01
