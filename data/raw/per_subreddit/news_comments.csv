Now is definitely not the time for Americans to let themselves be fooled by this narcissistic behaviour / corruption. It’s so disgusting. Corrupt narcissists lying to the public / tampering with evidence / using mass media as nothing more than a tool to push their agendas / controlling all legal systems etc. It’s so fucking sickening and people really need to unite / do something about it.

If you really think about it - they are effectively stealing from you / moving you closer and closer to slavery. Taxes that are meant to be used to pay for public services are instead going straight into the pockets of wealthy so they can build more resorts in their name / romanticise their egos.

I bet if every single person in America physically had Trump walk up to them at the end of every week to take 30-40% of their income - Americans would have done something about the corruption a long time ago.

If you make 2,000,000,000 a year, you probably spend around $300,000 a year.

These are fines, not fees.  Fees are something you pay to cover various costs.  Fines are a punishment.

In many other countries, reasonable fines are percentages based on worth, so that the rich actually avoid the behavior.  The fine needs to be strong enough to deter the behavior, not rubber stamp it as a slight cost if they get caught - one that is just a fraction of how much they gain by doing this over and over and not getting caught every time.

The fine needs to be many multiples of any financial gain, like 10-20x as much if not more.  Since it's so difficult to put these people in jail, it needs to be so high as to financially ruin anyone who tries it, and it needs to reach into their pockets not just shell companies they've set up to take the hit.

xAI raised about 20 billion from outside investors, at a valuation that puts xAI worth 75 billion.

In the end the original creditors are getting like a 20% haircut on their investment.

bribridude130,1jo04q9,"As an American conservative with favorable views of the French anti-immigration and nationalist movements, I commend the court in Paris for ruling Marine Le Pen guilty for misappropriating EU funds. I also commend that Le Pen will now be banned from running for political office for five years.

I am a believer in democracy and the rule of law above any political ideology, which are two of the core values of Western Civilization. I have always found it ironic how the many of the most ardent self-proclaimed defenders of Western Civilization are the worst violators of Western values, with the National Rally and many other European far-right politicians and parties (Salvini, AfD, PiS, Orban) as the biggest examples. The sentencing of Le Pen is a reminder that the rule of law must always prevail in France and everywhere, and an exposure of the hypocrisy of the Western far-right over claiming to ""defend the West"" while often violating the values of the very West they claim to defend.

Here is a post I made further detailing my opinions on Le Pen's conviction, future of French far-right, and the fight for Western Civilization: [https://www.reddit.com/r/eu/comments/1johjql/opinions\_regarding\_le\_pens\_conviction\_the\_future/](https://www.reddit.com/r/eu/comments/1johjql/opinions_regarding_le_pens_conviction_the_future/)",0,HellYeahDamnWrite,1jo04q9,mkrxvrx

stevez_86,1jo04q9,"Yeah, but it wasn't Trump's picks for the Supreme Court that have been pushing this. Roberts, Alito, and Thomas are downright diabolical.

Back when I had hope that Biden would do something, like an extraordinary times demands extraordinary measures kind of something, I thought removing those and leaving Trump's picks would force them to play ball. It's Roberts and his group that are uncompromising in their approach. The other people are young, they would have the chance to help write the better future if they were left in place and had to bite the hand that fed them to get them there, so they could prove their loyalty is to the country. There is no way of getting Roberts, Alito, and Thomas to change.

What the problem really was, was that Roberts and his people, the Federalist Society, told Biden and Garland that if they kept pushing that they would always side with Trump. Because having to rule on it was what they wanted all along. That allowed a map to be painted that Trump could use. The deal was they would slow roll and the Supreme Court would stop telling Trump HOW to legally take over the US. Otherwise the ambiguity left untested made his path more perilous.

It was a bargain they made to keep the safeguards we have in place, instead of outright ruling them incompetent in the face of Trump's arguments.

Instead Trump stabbed the Supreme Court in the back, as is his nature, and is pushing as if the roadmap they would have had painted, did in fact get ruled on and is going with what they said is legal, although untested and perilous.

Now the Supreme Court will have to decide if the monster they created can continue to exist in the environment they crafted for him. He is acting outside of the Constitution and they are not sure what to do. If they rule against him it makes the House of Cards they created weight bearing and if it collapses, well they have to go back and undo their previous rulings, which they could absolutely do, and tell him that he has to stop. That they were wrong and that Trump relinquished the office on January 6th because it WAS an illegal act.

Their theory hinges on the President being unable to break the law because there is no reason for a President to break the law. Therefore the attack on January 6th was a Presidential act. Even if he knew it was illegal, we cannot presume a President could act criminally. It would make every action the President takes challengeable in court. That is tested and the safeguards found to be sound, then a President couldn't act decisively. That is their argument. My argument is that if a President knowingly breaks the law, going against his office of legal council, then it can be challenged that the office was relinquished upon commission of that act.  It would need to prompt some kind of material harm to the President, if challenged, and it should be a required trigger for a vote in Congress to see if the Representatives of the States want the president to be immune.",2,savois-faire,mknz2j9,mkomcx3

There's two kinds of dangers. One is what I just talked about.

I mean, who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don't know anything about it? And the second reason that I'm worried about this is that science is more than a body of knowledge. It's a way of thinking. A way of skeptically interrogating the universe with a fine understanding of human fallibility. If we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we're up for grabs for the next charlatan political or religious who comes ambling along.",376,arthurno1,mko88ae,mkoays3

Liberty has its limits in every country in the world.  In the US, you aren’t allowed to run for President unless you are over the age of 35.  That is much more arbitrary than preventing a criminal from running while they are actively being punished for crimes they committed.

Keep in mind SK and Japan are still HIGHLY dependent on the US for military security against NK, China, and Russia. The US is the entirety of their nuclear deterrance.

I say this because specifics are important and having up to date perspectives are important. Much of Japan’s soft power and technological innovation has shifted over to South Korea. For reference, see their current economic crisis and housing crisis.

If anything the world powerhouses of the 21st century will be China and India, potentially Egypt, South Africa, or Nigeria, and if they ever figure it out, Brazil.

As it stands, these nations are going to boom with their populations industrializing and with their access to natural resources. Simply put, any country will NEED to interact with them in our resource scarce future. We also can’t assume the same comfort in relations with any of the above that could be assumed from Japan or South Korea during much of the past 60-70 years.

America doesn't want a trade war with Canada, let alone an actual war with Canada. Nobody wants to do the things Trump is doing. It's a very, very bizarre thing; Trump is gleefully starting conflicts that Americans don't want, basically with the entire world, and is sure that somehow it will work out in America's favor. When we're not prepared for a trade war. People voted for Trump cause of cost of living increases due to global inflation.

Trump is the archetype of the Ugly American; fat, rich for no reason, gaudy and unfashionable, old and in charge, boorish and unsophisticated, arrogant, loud, belligerent, stupid, and also actually ugly. He's the perfect figure for the world to unite against: old and out of touch for the young and growing economies, ungrateful and arrogant for our traditional allies, mean and miserly for the poor countries that he's cutting all the aid to. 

Americans are largely disconnected from world events and unaware of our reputation abroad. We're a physically large country and most Americans never travel to other nations. We're separated from most things due to oceans and (so far)friendly nations. Just how seriously other countries take our politicians, how much they can resent our irresponsible use of power, and how much it *means* when the president says or does something is lost on us.

The news mostly ignored the actual speakers, the point of the rally, didn’t appear to include any wide shots of the crowd to show its size in the final cut and spent way more time on the MAGA crew than it deserved.  

My new strategy at large protests is to find the corporate news crews (if there are any) and block their line of sight to MAGA with my sign until they point their cameras in the direction of the speakers and the actual hundreds-to-thousands of people who came for the cause of the event.

How many wars did China get itself involved in in the last 40 years, and how many did the US?

What has been China's military expenditure in the last 40 years, and what has been the US? How many houses, roads, infrastructure could the US have built with the difference? And how many social welfare programs could it have funded?

How much did China invest into it's industry, and how much did the US? Actually, the answer for that would be zero as far as the US is concerned, because in the US the government seldom invests anything into it's manufacturing capacity, leaving it to ""the market"" to decide weather and people and businesses succeed or fail, which is completely insane.

How much does the average Chinese citizen has to pay in order to afford basic necessities, or a home, or a car, and how much does the average US citizen?

Many young people in China like Japanese anime, and the largest number of foreign immigrants in Japan is also Chinese. The Chinese government looks at many things from a pragmatic perspective. When China was just founded, it also needed investment from Japan very much, and would not give up the opportunity to improve itself simply because of historical issues. However, once Japan's behavior reminds people of Japanese militarism, China's reaction will be very intense. If you think that China only regards Japan as a pure enemy, then many things cannot be explained. Moreover, China-Japan relations often depend on China-US relations. Japan once had a prime minister who tried to unite China and South Korea, but he immediately stepped down, and the matter was left unresolved. So I think the fact that all countries in the United States are collecting automobile tariffs may have a great impact on Japan, so that it may have to try to cooperate with China despite opposition from the United States.

During the January 6 capitol building protests there was a lot of argument about whether Trump was responsible for his followers storming the building. He claims he never did and would have never incited such a thing, but many of his fans certainly believed their actions were exactly what he was signaling that he wanted them to do. What we know for a fact is that he was very wishy-washy on the issue of condemning it and trying to prevent it, and he explicitly loved the implications of people performing such a stunt on his behalf. Many people see that as reason to hold him accountable on its own.

""As President, will you use your executive authority to ensure that transgender and nonbinary people who rely on the state for medical care — including those in prison and immigration detention — will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care? If yes, how will you do so?""

And her response was ""I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained.""

Then her team later followed up with confirmation that ""That questionnaire is not what she is proposing or running on.""

So not only was it she not the one who raised the topic to begin with, but she specified medically necessary care, AND this was from some questionnaire she participated in  years before she was even campaigning for herself. How long have you been losing sleep over this?

When I find a non-paywalled source for your second point, one that didn't just come from me googling ""kamala harris gender affirming care in schools"" and picking the first result, is it going to be another nothing-burger?

These topics are just rage bait fodder for simple-minded people to get scared over. I wanted a leader that either knew how to run an economy, or could surround themselves with people who knew how to run an economy. Now we've traded one senile dude for another, except this one is tanking every quantifiable metric of US success at the same time",1,MyDudeX,mkrbh6s,mkrpgdc
MyDudeX,1jo7n0i,"Think of what Bill or Obama would do in that situation. They would disregard the question entirely and move on to things that mattered. I'm not the one losing sleep over this, I voted for Kamala, I know it's all a bunch of smoke screen bullshit but the left isn't doing itself any favors by latching onto it or paying it any mind and allowing the right to spin it into the whole platform. The left needs to work on being inclusive to regular people the same way the right does.",1,r0llingthund3r,mkrpgdc,mkrrf6x
